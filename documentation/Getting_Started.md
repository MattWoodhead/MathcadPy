# MathcadPy - Getting Started
How to get started with MathcadPy

### Requirements
- [Mathcad Prime 3+](https://www.mathcad.com/) Ensure that you have got PTC Mathcad Prime installed. This wrapper has been tested with Mathcad Prime versions 3, 4 and 5.
- [win32com](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32) MathcadPy uses the pywin32 package to interact with the Mathcad COM api. This should automatically be installed when you use pip to install MathcadPy, but you can also install it before hand or use an existing installation.


### Installation
MathcadPy has been released on PyPI, so installation is simple as follows:
    pip install MathcadPy
Thats it!
